We created '**Where are U from**(**WAUF**)' with the goal of bringing transparency to the distribution network of clothing. 
When consumers purchase garments, they often lack information about the production processes involved and whether harmful materials were used. 

Furthermore, distinguishing between genuine and counterfeit items can be challenging. 
**WAUF** leverages blockchain technology to engrave the entire clothing supply chain, allowing for trustworthy and secure transactions.


By doing so, users gain access to valuable insights about the origin of products, the materials used, and the production processes involved. 
**WAYF** enhances trust between consumers and sellers, fostering a more transparent and ethical consumer culture. 
It empowers consumers to make informed decisions when purchasing clothing, while enabling brands and manufacturers to effectively manage and verify their products and production processes.

**TheGraph**: blockchain technology to record every step of the clothing distribution process. We specifically employ **Gnosis** and **Aurora** Chain. **WAUF** leverages TheGraph to query and retrieve events recorded during the distribution process, which often involves intricate interconnections between various distributors and specific items. 

TheGraph acts as a powerful tool that enables the efficient extraction of information from the complex web of relationships within the distribution network. 

It helps untangle the intricacies and interdependencies within the system, allowing users to easily navigate and access the desired data they are seeking. 

With TheGraph, users can effectively trace the path of a particular item, track its journey through multiple stages of distribution, and gain a comprehensive understanding of its origin and the entities involved in its supply chain.
